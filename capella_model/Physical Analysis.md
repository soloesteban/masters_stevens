# Physical analysis (PA)

> “How the system will be built”.

The Physical Analysis perspective defines the finalized architecture of the system, as it should be completed and integrated. It adds the functions required by the implementation and technical choices, and reveals the behavioural components that perform these functions. These behavioural components are then implemented using host implementation components that offer them the necessary material resource.
