The Physical Analysis perspective defines the finalized architecture of the system, as it should be completed and integrated. It adds the functions required by the implementation and technical choices, and reveals the behavioral components that perform these functions. These behavioral components are then implemented using host implementation components that offer them the necessary material resource.
