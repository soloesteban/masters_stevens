# Operational Analysis

The following was migrated to the Quarto report
> "What the system users must achieve”.

The Operational Analysis perspective analyses the issue of operational users, by identifying stakeholders that have to interact with the system, their goals, activities, constraints and the interaction conditions between them. This perspective allows to model the required high-level operational capabilities and perform an operational needs analysis without even defining the system-of-interest, in fact the system is not even mentioned at this layer.
