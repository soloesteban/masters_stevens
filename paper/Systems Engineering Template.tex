your article to the journal.\selectlanguage{english}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.70\columnwidth]{figures/example-image-rectangle/example-image-rectangle}
\caption{{\textbf{Please replace this figure.} Although we encourage authors to
send us the highest-quality figures possible, for peer-review purposes
we are can accept a wide variety of formats, sizes, and resolutions.
Legends should be concise but comprehensive -- the figure and its legend
must be understandable without reference to the text. Include
definitions of any symbols used and define/explain all abbreviations and
units of measurement.

\subsection*{LaTeX and Mathematical notation}
\label{sec:latex}
You can also include LaTeX code in your documents. Here is a simple inline equation $e^{i\pi}=-1$ and here's a longer equation, numbered:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:some}
\int_0^{+\infty}e^{-x^2}dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Adding Citations and a References
List}

You can cite bibliographic entries easily in Authorea. For example, here
are a couple of citations~\cite{Cavalleri_2016,Gregory_2015}. By default citations are
formatted according to a format accepted by the journal. Here is one
more citation~\cite{Meskine_2019}
