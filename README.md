This is the GitHub repository of a Masters Project for Systems Engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology.

**Candidate**: Esteban M. Solórzano Zeledón

The project consists of modeling and documenting a system to capture, manage and publish knowledge of best practices for performing systems engineering of medical devices.

Some of the documents and artifacts of this project are modeled in SysML and documented in markdown (.md). This is to facilitate:
- platform independence,
- standerization,
- publishing flexibility,
- reuse,
- and transfer.

Note: As needed publishing will be performed in formats such as Microsoft Word, Latex and PDF.
