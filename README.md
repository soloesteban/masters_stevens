This is the GitHub repository of a Masters Project for Systems Engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology.

**Candidate**: Esteban M. Solórzano Zeledón

The project consists of modeling and documenting a system to capture, manage and publish knowledge of best practices how to perform systems engineering of medical devices.

Several of the documents and artifacts of this project are modeled in SysML, Capella and documented in markdown (.md). This enables:
- platform independence,
- standerization,
- publishing flexibility,
- reuse,
- and transfer.

The markdown is primarily done using Visual Studio Code.

Note: As needed publishing will be provided in formats such as Microsoft Word, Latex and PDF.
