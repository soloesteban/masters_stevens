- Printed Handouts to links to the project draft report and survey where shared at:

    - First INCOSE Healthcare Risk Management Conference held on April 22 at Medtronic Operations Headquarters in Minnesota.

    - 2024 INCOSE Healthcare Conference held from April 23 to 25 in Minneapolis, MN.

    - IEC TC62 at the IEC 60601-1 4 edition working groups meetings at AAMI in Arlington Virginia held from April 29 to May 3.

- In person Poster Presentation in the Boston Scientific Global Technology Exposition (GTE) to occur at Arden Hills, MN on May 29.

- Esteban offers to provide in the future some lectures based on sections of the book we are developing on Medical Device Systems Engineering (MDSE). This would serve a dual purpose:

    - Validate Book Content: present draft chapters to students and gather valuable feedback on their clarity, usefulness, and comprehensiveness. Note: Tailor the lectures to align with relevant courses in the Masters in Systems Engineering program.

    - Prepare for PhD Path: The lectures will provide an opportunity to practice and refine teaching skills, which would be beneficial as Esteban considers pursuing a PhD.
