|--------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Focus**               | Safety and regulatory compliance (FDA requirements)                  | Performance, reliability, and safety for critical applications                         | Safety, cost-effectiveness, and manufacturability                 | Cost, functionality, and user experience                                       |
| **Life Cycle**          | Highly regulated with strict change control processes                | Long development cycles with significant upfront investment                            | Cyclical development with model year changes                      | Fast-paced development with shorter product lifecycles                         |
| **Stakeholders**        | Broader range including patients, doctors, and regulatory bodies     | Primarily engineers, government agencies, and airline customers                        | Consumers, dealerships, and regulatory bodies                     | Consumers, retailers, and internal marketing/design teams                      |
| **Risk Management**     | Extremely high focus on mitigating risks to patient safety           | High focus on mitigating risks of catastrophic failure                                 | Focus on safety while balancing cost and manufacturability        | Focus on user safety and product liability                                     |
| **Cost Considerations** | Balancing cost-effectiveness with safety and regulatory requirements | Cost is a major driver, but safety remains paramount                                   | Balancing cost with performance and consumer expectations         | Cost is a major driver, with emphasis on economies of scale                    |

|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**           | **Safety and Regulatory Compliance**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Performance and Technical Specifications**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Example**         | A cardiac pacemaker is being developed. Systems engineers ensure the device meets all FDA requirements for electromagnetic interference (EMI) to prevent malfunction near other medical equipment.                                                     | An airplane wing is being designed. Systems engineers focus on weight, strength, and aerodynamic efficiency to achieve optimal fuel consumption and flight performance.                                                                 |
| **Life Cycle**      | **Highly Regulated with Strict Change Control Processes**                                                                                                                                                                                              | **More Flexible and Iterative Development Cycles**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Example**         | A software bug is discovered in a blood glucose monitor after initial release. Due to strict change control, rigorous testing and regulatory approval are required before deploying the fix, potentially delaying the update.                          | During the development of a new car model, engineers discover a minor issue with the infotainment system. A software patch can be released relatively quickly through an over-the-air update.                                           |
| **Stakeholders**    | **Broader Range Including Patients, Doctors, and Regulatory Bodies**                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Primarily Engineers and Internal Stakeholders**                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Example**         | Systems engineers for a new insulin pump consider not only technical specifications but also user needs (e.g., easy for elderly patients to operate) and feedback from doctors regarding functionality and integration with existing hospital systems. | While developing a new type of engine, the primary focus for systems engineers might be on meeting internal performance targets set by the company and collaborating with mechanical and electrical engineers on achieving those goals. |
| **Risk Management** | **Extremely High Focus on Mitigating Risks to Patient Safety**                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Risk Management is Important, But Tolerances May Be Higher**                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Example**         | A potential risk identified during the development of a surgical robot is the possibility of unintended arm movement during delicate procedures. Systems engineers prioritize implementing safeguards and redundancy measures to minimize this risk.   | When designing a new bridge, there's a risk of structural failure during an earthquake. While safety is crucial, there might be a tolerance for a certain level of risk based on cost-benefit analysis and engineering calculations.    |
