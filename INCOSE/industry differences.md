## How Medical Device Systems Engineering might differ compared to other industries:

<!--

Run a poll in the INCOSE Healthcare LinkedIn group asking about what is different between systems engineering the medical device industry versus other industries.3

Review with SMEs from other industries if they agree with the features of their industry. I should tell Chris Unger about that

Proposed table caption: "Comparative Analysis of Systems Engineering Approaches Across Industries: Medical Device, Aerospace, Automotive, and Consumer Electronics"

The table presents a comparative analysis of systems engineering practices across four diverse industries: Medical Device, Aerospace, Automotive, and Consumer Electronics. Each industry operates within distinct regulatory frameworks, market demands, and stakeholder expectations, leading to unique approaches in managing safety, performance, cost, complexity, and customization in product development.

The information in the table could be sourced from various reputable sources, including:

Industry Reports and Studies: Reports published by market research firms specializing in each industry, such as Frost & Sullivan, Gartner, or Deloitte, often provide comprehensive analyses of industry trends, challenges, and best practices in systems engineering.
Regulatory Agencies: Regulatory bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the medical device industry, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for aerospace, or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for automotive, publish guidelines, regulations, and industry insights that influence systems engineering practices.

|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Focus**           | **Safety and Regulatory Compliance**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Performance and Technical Specifications**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Example**         | A cardiac pacemaker is being developed. Systems engineers ensure the device meets all FDA requirements for electromagnetic interference (EMI) to prevent malfunction near other medical equipment.                                                     | An airplane wing is being designed. Systems engineers focus on weight, strength, and aerodynamic efficiency to achieve optimal fuel consumption and flight performance.                                                                 |
| **Life Cycle**      | **Highly Regulated with Strict Change Control Processes**                                                                                                                                                                                              | **More Flexible and Iterative Development Cycles**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Example**         | A software bug is discovered in a blood glucose monitor after initial release. Due to strict change control, rigorous testing and regulatory approval are required before deploying the fix, potentially delaying the update.                          | During the development of a new car model, engineers discover a minor issue with the infotainment system. A software patch can be released relatively quickly through an over-the-air update.                                           |
| **Stakeholders**    | **Broader Range Including Patients, Doctors, and Regulatory Bodies**                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Primarily Engineers and Internal Stakeholders**                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Example**         | Systems engineers for a new insulin pump consider not only technical specifications but also user needs (e.g., easy for elderly patients to operate) and feedback from doctors regarding functionality and integration with existing hospital systems. | While developing a new type of engine, the primary focus for systems engineers might be on meeting internal performance targets set by the company and collaborating with mechanical and electrical engineers on achieving those goals. |
| **Risk Management** | **Extremely High Focus on Mitigating Risks to Patient Safety**                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Risk Management is Important, But Tolerances May Be Higher**                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Example**         | A potential risk identified during the development of a surgical robot is the possibility of unintended arm movement during delicate procedures. Systems engineers prioritize implementing safeguards and redundancy measures to minimize this risk.   | When designing a new bridge, there's a risk of structural failure during an earthquake. While safety is crucial, there might be a tolerance for a certain level of risk based on cost-benefit analysis and engineering calculations.    |
