# Methodology

## General methods

The following methodology was used for the Masters Project in Systems Engineering.

- Use Stevens Institute of Technology guidelines and templates for masters project.

- Develop the "knowledge repository" as a system: stakeholder needs, concept, architecture, models, requirements, verification/validation.

- Select and utilize systems engineering methods and tools from courses of Stevens School of Systems and Enterprises.

- Select and utilize industry standards such as IEC 15288 and the INCOSE (International Council on Systems Engineering) Systems Engineering Handbook.

- Literature Review: Conduct an extensive review of existing literature, research papers, and relevant resources in the field of systems engineering and medical devices.

- Interviews and Surveys: Collect insights and best practices from industry experts, professionals, and academics in both systems engineering and medical device development.

- Content Development: Create well-structured chapters and sections based on the outlined scope, ensuring clarity and coherence throughout the book.

- Graphics and Illustrations: Include diagrams, flowcharts, and illustrations to enhance understanding and provide practical examples.

- Peer Review: Seek input and feedback from experts in the field to validate the content's accuracy and relevance.

- Use Git and/or GitHub as repository for the masterâ€™s project artifacts.
