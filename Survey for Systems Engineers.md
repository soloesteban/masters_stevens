## Medical Device Systems Engineering Book Survey

The following are proposed questions for a survey directed to systems engineering who work in the medical device industry.

1. How would you rate your overall experience as a systems engineer in the medical device industry?

Feedback from Howard: the question is too vague. There are too many dimensions in the response.
Suggestion of a better question: Can you identify the most important subject areas I wish I knew more about?

Tell me about the most challenging situation you faced (hard lesson) but wished you learned first.

Opportunity: Reveal what the reader wants to learn or wishes someone has told them.

The most valuable things to for a systems engineer:
- Asking the right question
- Stating the right problem
- Active lisiteninig
- Identify when someone is lying to you.
- Identify when views are prejudice. (How they look at the world)
- Identify a threshold of carry (it matters). Where does error become relevant and where is does not become irrelevant. How wrong can it be and still be ok. When do things become relevant and not irrelevant.

2. What specific challenges do you face in the systems engineering of medical devices and systems?

3. What key topics or areas would you like a dedicated book on medical device systems engineering to cover?

4. On a scale of 1 to 5, how important is practical, real-world case studies and examples in a systems engineering book for medical devices?

5. What types of tools or methodologies do you find most valuable in your day-to-day work as a systems engineer for medical devices?

6. How crucial do you believe collaboration and communication between different engineering disciplines are in the development of medical device systems?

7. What level of detail would you prefer in a book: broad concepts with high-level overviews or in-depth technical details with specific examples?

8. Are there any specific regulations or standards you feel should be addressed in a comprehensive medical device systems engineering book?

9. Would you prefer the book to focus more on theoretical frameworks or practical implementation strategies in the context of medical device systems engineering?

10. Are there any specific formats (e.g., printed book, e-book, interactive online content) that you find most accessible and beneficial for learning?
