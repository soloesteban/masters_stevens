Implement the survey using online form tools such as Survey Monkey.

Adam did suggest to use adverbs to get data of what topics the systems engineers who work in medical devices are looking for.

## Medical Device Systems Engineering Book Survey

The following are proposed questions for a survey directed to systems engineering who work in the medical device industry.

<!---

The following question was dropped due to feedback:
1. How would you rate your overall experience as a systems engineer in the medical device industry?


Feedback from the meeting with Nathan and Adam on Feb 14, 2024
Nathan Brown on says you are asking someone to evaluate themselves. You will get people who think they are really good. No value of it. Suggestion to drop question 1.

Adam says it would be better to quantify what projects they had, problems they faced. Quantify in time.

Feedback from Howard Simms on Feb 9, 2024:
Howard said that the question is too vague. There are too many dimensions in the response.
Suggestion of a better question: Can you identify the most important subject areas I wish I knew more about?

Tell me about the most challenging situation you faced (hard lesson) but wished you learned first.

Opportunity: Reveal what the reader wants to learn or wishes someone has told them.

The most valuable things to for a systems engineer:
- Ask the right question
- State the right problem
- Active listening
- Identify when someone is lying to you.
- Identify when there are prejudice views. (How someone views the world)
- Identify a "do I care" threshold (when it matters).
- Where does error become relevant and where is does not become irrelevant. How wrong can it be and still be ok. When do things become relevant and not irrelevant.

Comments from meeting on Feb 14, 2024
Nathan Brown says its a little broad. Needs to be rewritten to have a selection of challanges and probably include a write in field. Determine what are the challanges and allow people to select from.

Regulatory Compliance: Meeting regulatory standards such as FDA requirements in the US or CE marking in the EU is crucial. Navigating the regulatory landscape and ensuring compliance throughout the development process can be challenging and time-consuming.

Safety and Efficacy: Ensuring the safety and efficacy of the medical device is paramount. Designing systems that reliably perform their intended functions without causing harm to the patient requires thorough risk analysis and validation.

Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Developing medical devices often requires collaboration between various disciplines such as engineering, medicine, biology, and regulatory affairs. Effective communication and collaboration among these different groups can be a challenge, especially when addressing technical and regulatory complexities.

Complexity of Systems Integration: Medical devices often consist of multiple subsystems that must work together seamlessly. Integrating these subsystems while maintaining safety, reliability, and performance can be challenging, particularly when dealing with hardware-software interactions.

Cybersecurity: With the increasing connectivity of medical devices to networks and other devices, ensuring cybersecurity is a significant concern. Protecting patient data and preventing unauthorized access to the device's operation are critical challenges in modern medical device design.

Usability and Human Factors: Designing medical devices that are intuitive and easy to use for healthcare professionals and patients is essential for patient safety and user acceptance. Incorporating human factors engineering principles to optimize usability can be challenging, especially for complex devices.

Lifecycle Management: Managing the entire lifecycle of a medical device, from conception through obsolescence, requires careful planning and execution. Issues such as component availability, software updates, and maintenance must be addressed to ensure the device remains safe and effective throughout its lifespan.

Cost Constraints: Balancing the need for innovation and quality with cost constraints is a common challenge in medical device development. Finding ways to optimize design and manufacturing processes to reduce costs without compromising safety and efficacy is essential.

Global Market Access: Expanding into international markets brings additional challenges related to regulatory compliance, cultural differences, and varying healthcare systems. Ensuring that the device meets the requirements of different regulatory authorities and addresses the needs of diverse patient populations can be complex.

Emerging Technologies: Keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and advanced materials presents both opportunities and challenges for medical device engineers. Integrating these technologies into medical devices while ensuring safety and efficacy requires careful consideration and expertise.

Dropped the following question due to feedback:
3. What key topics or areas would you like a dedicated book on medical device systems engineering to cover?

Comments from meeting with Nathan and Adam on Feb 14, 2024:
Suggestion from Nathan to provide a list to choose from.
Adam says that if question number 2 was written better it could answer question number 3. For example "What percentage of projects were late due to ______? A Pareto from question 2 can provide the topics.

Dropped the following question due to feedback:
4. On a scale of 1 to 5, how important is practical, real-world case studies and examples in a systems engineering book for medical devices?

Comments from meeting with Nathan and Adam on Feb 14, 2024:
Probably most people would answer high. It is kind of expected people would want examples.
Adam says a personalized story matters to a lot of people. Probably this question would not generate new learnings.
-->

2. What tools do you find most valuable in your day-to-day work as a systems engineer for medical devices?
Examples of tools are: Cameo Systems Modeler, JIRA, Capella, hardware tools.

3. What methodologies do you find most valuable in your day-to-day work as a systems engineer for medical devices?
Examples of methodologies are: MBSE, trade studies, SysML.

<!---
Comments from meeting with Nathan and Adam on Feb 14, 2024:
Nathan to split the question into tools and methodologies
Maybe more focus on methodologies than tools. You can use Excel for a House of Quality.

Adam says people would be looking or be interested in real world solutions using tools that implement methodologies.
Think what I'm going to do with the answers I get back.
-->

4. Which engineering disciplines grasp the deliverables and artifacts of systems engineering?

<!---
6. How crucial do you believe collaboration and communication between different engineering disciplines are in the development of medical device systems?

Comments from meeting with Nathan and Adam on Feb 14, 2024:
Adam says "Which engineering disciplines understand the systems engineering language?" Example SysML makes sense to Jim Sievert because of UML familiarity but does not makes sense for Mechanical Engineers.
Language to engineer compatibility and interface.
Nathan needs more time to analyze this question.
-->

5. What level of detail would you prefer in a book: broad concepts with high-level overviews or in-depth technical details with specific examples?

<!---
Comments from meeting on Feb 14, 2024
Adam says "What are examples one or more books that you have read that resonated for you as a systems engineer in medical devices? And why"

Need to word smith this question.
-->

6. Are there any specific regulations or standards you feel should be addressed in a comprehensive medical device systems engineering book?

<!---
Comments from meeting on Feb 14, 2024
Adam said: Use tools such as Adwords to find what people have been searching for. Consult INCOSE there could be support to get Adwords.

Note: Be wary of people lying in surveys.
-->

7. Would you prefer the book to focus more on theoretical frameworks or practical implementation strategies in the context of medical device systems engineering?


8. Are there any specific formats (e.g., printed book, e-book, interactive online content) that you find most accessible and beneficial for learning?
