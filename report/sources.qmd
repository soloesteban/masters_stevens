-   Maheshwari, Apoorv. (2015). Application of Systems Engineering to Regulatory Compliance Activities for Medical Devices. [@maheshwari2015]
-   Corns, S. and Gibson, C. (2012), A Model-based Reference Architecture for Medical Device Development. INCOSE International Symposium, 22: 2066-2075.Â <https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2334-5837.2012.tb01457.x> [@corns2012]

## Medical Device Trends

The FDA provides public databases and reports that can provide insight of what are the most common medical devices that are in use and the characteristics of those devices [@health2024].

### Medical Device Classification

@fig-distribution_class_medical_device shows the distribution in percentage of medical devices registered with the FDA by class, as of February 1, 2024.

::: {#fig-distribution_class_medical_device}
![](images/paste-20.png)

Distribution of Medical Devices Registered with the FDA (as of February 1, 2024)
:::

Here's a breakdown of the data displayed in the chart:

-   Class III makes up the largest portion of registered devices at around 60%.

-   Class II is the second most common class of device at around 35%.

-   Class I devices and "Other" devices each make up a smaller portion of registered devices.

It is important to note that the FDA regulates medical devices based on the level of risk they pose to patients. Class III devices are considered the highest risk, while Class I devices are considered the lowest risk [@health2023].

### Implantable versus non-implantable

@fig-implantable_versus_plantable is a line graph that shows the percentage of implantable and non-implantable medical devices.

::: {#fig-implantable_versus_plantable}
![](images/paste-21.png)

Proportion of Implantable vs. Non-Implantable Medical Devices Registered with the FDA (as of February 1, 2024)
:::

The data shows that as of February 1, 2024, implantable medical devices make up a smaller percentage of registered devices than non-implantable devices.

Implantable medical devices are devices that are inserted into the body for a long period of time. Examples of implantable medical devices include pacemakers, artificial hips, and breast implants. Non-implantable medical devices are devices that are used on the body but are not inserted into it. Examples of non-implantable medical devices include stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, and bandages.

### Medical Specialties

@fig-Medical_Devices_Specialty shows the distribution of FDA-registered medical devices by medical specialty, based on FDA product codes, as of February 1, 2024.

::: {#fig-Medical_Devices_Specialty}
![](images/paste-22.png)

Distribution of FDA-Registered Medical Devices by Medical Specialty (as of February 1, 2024)
:::

Here's what we can gleaned from the chart:

-   **Specialties with the most devices:** The specialties with the highest percentage of registered devices are:

    -   Orthopedic

    -   General and Plastic Surgery

    -   Cardiovascular

    -   General Hospital

-   **Specialties with the least devices:** The specialties with the lowest percentage of registered devices are:

    -   Clinical Toxicology

    -   Immunology

    -   Microbiology

    -   Clinical Chemistry

    -   Hematology

It's important to note that the number of devices registered in a particular specialty doesn't necessarily reflect the number of procedures performed in that specialty. For example, there may be a relatively small number of complex orthopedic devices compared to the number of simple bandages used in wound care, but both would be classified under orthopedic devices.

Some reasons why some specialties might have more devices than others:

-   **Surgical specialties:** Surgical specialties tend to have a wider variety of devices because they use devices for a variety of procedures.

-   **Chronic conditions:** Specialties that treat chronic conditions may have a wider variety of devices because they may use devices to monitor or treat the condition over time.

### FDA Product Code

@fig-FDA_Product_Codes_Terms_Devices is word cloud that highlights the most frequent terms from FDA Product Codes of registered devices.

::: {#fig-FDA_Product_Codes_Terms_Devices}
![](images/paste-23.png)

Most frequent FDA Product Codes Terms of the registered devices (as of February 1, 2024)
:::

Based on the word cloud, the most frequent FDA Product Code Terms for registered medical devices with the FDA as of February 1, 2024:

-   **Surgical**

-   **Tracheostomy**

-   **Cardiovascular**

-   **Wireless**

-   **Synthetic**

-   **Adult**

-   **Cervical**

-   **Spinal**

-   **Electrode**

-   **Plastic**

It appears that surgical devices and those used in cardiology are the most common. There is also a high prevalence of terms related to materials like synthetic and plastic, along with terms related to location or application like cervical and tracheostomy.
