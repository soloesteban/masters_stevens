	abstract = {The application of systems engineering within the medical device domain must adapt to its unique challenges such-as the regulatory environment that these devices have to be designed within to ensure patient safety, and the nature of the interactions between the device and the patient. The sheer number of regulations imposed by government agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and various international agencies adds to the complexity of designing these systems. This also presents an opportunity to implement a Model-Based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}) approach to capture the regulatory environment and map those specialized requirements to components within the system that address those requirements. In this study, we present a model of a reference architecture that can be used as a starting point for the system design of medical devices. Although the state of the model has not been fully matured, this approach offers the potential to more efficiently address the complex regulatory requirements, and reduce the time to design medical devices.},

	abstract = {Many life saving devices come with significant risk which must be mitigated through a defined system design process. A seamless integration of the design and development process and the safety risk management process will allow devices to be safety used on humans. The development process is described in {ISO} 13485, the international standard for the development of medical devices. {ISO} 14971 is the international standard for the evaluation of the safety risk of a medical device. A system engineering approach to the design of medical devices provides a holistic approach to ensuring these devices are safe for their intended use. Universities and companies hoping to use their devices in clinical trials on patients are required to follow a well-defined process incorporating design and development planning, design input, design output, design review, design verification, and design validation. The safety risk management process must be carefully overlaid on top of this standard development process. This paper will describe acceptable development processes, including agile and evolutionary design. It will also describe the methodology used to develop devices intended for clinical trials on patients, prior to commercialization. It will briefly describe the requirements of clinical trials performed on humans and will cover the key elements of the safety risk management process.},
