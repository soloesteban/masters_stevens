This section explains the functional archicture of the MedSE Knowledge Repository system.

```{=html}
<!--
Functional Decomposition. Use IDEF0 preferibly

Some ideas of functions:

add content
update content
remove content
store content
view content
decode content (video, text)
serach content
browse content
protect content (access rights)
backup content


Perform a trace matrix to use cases. Use Gemini to suggest functions from the sequence diagrams.

Perform a trace matrix to requirements. I would need to trace requirements to functions. Probably this trace matrix would be better to be shown in the requirements section of this report.

Perform allocation to physical components from the Physical Architecture.

## IDEF0 Diagram of Medical Device Systems Engineering Knowledge Repository

**Function:** Medical Device Systems Engineering Knowledge Repository

**Parent Function:** (Not Applicable)

**Inputs:**

-   Update Knowledge (Arrow): This arrow represents data flowing into the system from an administrator who wants to update existing knowledge within the repository.

-   Delete Knowledge (Arrow): This arrow represents data flowing into the system from an administrator who wants to delete knowledge from the repository.

-   Knowledge Sources (Arrow): This arrow represents data flowing into the system from various sources such as literature, experts, academics, standards, and regulations.


**Outputs:**

-   Systems Engineering Information (Arrow): This arrow represents data flowing out of the system to a systems engineer who is consulting the repository for information on performing systems engineering of a medical device.


**Controls:**

-   Access Control (Arrow): This arrow represents a control mechanism that restricts access to update and delete functions to authorized administrators only.


**Mechanisms:**

-   Knowledge Base (Box): This box represents the core function of the system, which is to store the knowledge related to medical device systems engineering.

-   Knowledge Management (Box): This box represents the functions responsible for processing knowledge updates and deletions initiated by administrators.

-   Information Retrieval (Box): This box represents the function responsible for retrieving relevant systems engineering information based on a systems engineer's query.


**Child Functions:**

-   Maintain Knowledge Base (Arrow): This arrow represents the breakdown of the Knowledge Base function into a child diagram that would detail the processes for storing, organizing, and indexing knowledge within the system.

-   Process Update Request (Arrow): This arrow represents the breakdown of the Knowledge Management function into a child diagram that would detail the steps involved in processing an administrator's request to update knowledge.

-   Process Delete Request (Arrow): This arrow represents the breakdown of the Knowledge Management function into a child diagram that would detail the steps involved in processing an administrator's request to delete knowledge.

-   Generate Systems Engineering Information (Arrow): This arrow represents the breakdown of the Information Retrieval function into a child diagram that would detail the process of searching the knowledge base and compiling relevant information based on a systems engineer's query.

An IDEF0 diagram, also known as Integration Definition for Function Modeling, is a graphical tool used to depict the functionalities of a system or process. It's essentially a flowchart that breaks down activities and how they interact with data and controls. Some aspects of IDEF0 diagrams:


-   **Function Modeling:** They focus on the functions, decisions, and actions that take place within a system \[2\].

-   **Standardized Symbols:** IDEF0 uses a specific set of symbols to represent activities (boxes), data flows (arrows), mechanisms (arrows), and controls (arrows) \[3\].

-   **Hierarchical Breakdown:** Complex processes can be broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-processes using a series of interconnected diagrams \[6\].
