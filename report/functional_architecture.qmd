<!--
Functional Decomposition. Use IDEF0 preferibly

Some ideas of functions:

add content
update content
remove content
store content
view content
decode content (video, text)
serach content
browse content

Perform a trace matrix to use cases. Use Gemini to suggest functions from the sequence diagrams.

Perform a trace matrix to requirements. I would need to trace requirements to functions. Probably this trace matrix would be better to be shown in the requirements section of this report.

Perform allocation to physical components from the Physical Architecture.
