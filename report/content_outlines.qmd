This section provided some proposed configurations for the MDSEE-KR content sections. The proposals were mainly derived from the data presented in the [Sources](/sources.qmd) and [Survey Results](/survey_results.qmd) sections of this report. The relationship of the elements called content section and content and its types were modeled in the [Physical Architecture](/physical_architecture.qmd) section of this report.
