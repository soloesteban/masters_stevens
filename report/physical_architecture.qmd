> “How the system will be built”.

The Physical Analysis perspective defines the finalized architecture of the system, as it should be completed and integrated. It adds the functions required by the implementation and technical choices, and reveals the behavioral components that perform these functions. These behavioral components are then implemented using host implementation components that offer them the necessary material resource.

## Top Level System Breakdown

![](images/paste-1.png)

The image is a SysML block definition diagram (BDD) for a physical architecture. It shows the breakdown of a system into its parts at a high level. Here’s a breakdown of the components:

-   **Knowledge Repository:** This block stores knowledge, the data that the system operates on.

-   **Search Engine:** This block finds information within the knowledge repository. It takes a search query as input and provides results.

-   **Maintenance Mechanism:** This block is responsible for maintaining the system. It includes an update mechanism and access control.

    -   **Update Mechanism:** This block updates the knowledge repository.

    -   **Access Control:** This block controls access to the system, by authenticating users.

-   **Storage:** This block stores data, the knowledge repository or other system data.

-   **User Interface:** This block allows users to interact with the system. It provides content to the user and can receive content from the user.

-   **Display:** This block presents information to the user.

-   **Content:** This block refers to the data that is presented by the user interface and displayed.

-   **Metadata:** This block provides data about other blocks in the system.

The diagram also shows the relationships between these blocks. For example, the search engine has a part relationship with the knowledge repository. This means that the search engine is a component of the knowledge repository. The user interface also has a content relationship with the content block. This means that the user interface displays content.
