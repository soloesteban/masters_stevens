## Stakeholders expectations {#sec-stakeholders_expectations}

Stakeholder expectations were elicited from the stakeholders and documented in @tbl-sacred_expectations. The stakeholders were interviewed and/or surveyed to record their expectations. Not all stakeholders were addressed directly, this was case of the medical device regulatory bodies. Published medical device regulations were consulted to determine what are the expectations of the Regulatory Bodies.

## Concept of Operations {#sec-concept_operations}

This section defines the system context for the MedSE knowledge repository. The analysis employs a SysML block definition diagram.

A context diagram is a diagram that defines the boundary between the system, or part of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it. [@systemc2019] 

The context diagram shows the system’s inputs and outputs and sets a baseline for developing the internal architecture [@larson2009]. Context is what surrounds the system. It contains entities that are “just on the outside of the system” but are relevant to it [@crawley2015].

@fig-system_context shows the Medical Device System context.

<!--Insert system context diagram image here. Create caption and update cross references -->
