```{=html}
<!--
A Medical Device Systems Engineer is an engineer who applies systems engineering principles to the development of medical devices. They  work to ensure the entire medical device,  from concept to fruition, functions cohesively and meets all regulatory requirements.

Here's a breakdown of their role:

- Big Picture Thinkers: They consider the entire medical device system, including hardware, software, and user interface, ensuring everything works together seamlessly [2].

- Standards and Regulations: Medical device development is highly regulated to ensure patient safety. These engineers understand and adhere to relevant standards like FDA regulations in the US [2].

- From Concept to Completion: They are involved in various stages of the development lifecycle, from defining user needs and translating them into technical requirements to design, testing, and production [3, 5].

- Technical Expertise: They possess a strong foundation in engineering principles often with a focus on electromechanical systems [3].

- Communication and Collaboration: They collaborate effectively with a cross-functional team including designers, software engineers, and regulatory specialists [3].

## Stakeholders expectations {#sec-stakeholders_expectations}

Stakeholder expectations were elicited from the stakeholders and documented in @tbl-sacred_expectations. The stakeholders were interviewed and/or surveyed to record their expectations. Not all stakeholders were addressed directly, this was case of the medical device regulatory bodies. Published medical device regulations were consulted to determine what are the expectations of the Regulatory Bodies.

## Concept of Operations {#sec-concept_operations}

This section defines the system context for the MDSE-KR. The analysis employs a SysML block definition diagram.

A context diagram is a diagram that defines the boundary between the system, or part of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it. [@systemc2019] 

The context diagram shows the system’s inputs and outputs and sets a baseline for developing the internal architecture [@larson2009]. Context is what surrounds the system. It contains entities that are “just on the outside of the system” but are relevant to it [@crawley2015].

@fig-system_context is a SysML diagram of the system context for the Medical Device Systems Engineering Knowledge Repository. It depicts the system and its interaction with external entities.

<!--Insert system context diagram image here. Create caption and update cross references -->

::: {#fig-system_context}
<!--![](images/paste-3.png)-->

![](images/paste-47.png)

Medical Device System Context Diagram
:::

The following is a breakdown of the system context diagram:

**Blocks:**

-   **Knowledge Repository:** This is the central block of the system, which stores medical device systems engineering knowledge.

-   **Medical Device Systems Engineer:** This block represents the users of the system who can request knowledge from the repository.

-   **Administrator:** This block represents the system administrator who can manage the knowledge repository, including adding, updating, and deleting knowledge.

-   **Standards Organizations:** This block represents external organizations that provide medical device systems engineering standards and regulations.

-   **Academics:** This block represents academic institutions that contribute medical device systems engineering knowledge to the repository.

-   **Non-Profit Organizations:** This block represents non-profit organizations that contribute medical device systems engineering knowledge to the repository.

**Flows:**

-   **Knowledge:** This flow shows the knowledge that is stored in the repository. It goes in two directions, indicating that knowledge can be added to the repository and retrieved from it.

-   **Knowledge Request:** This flow shows the request for knowledge from a medical device systems engineer to the knowledge repository.

-   **Commands:** This flow shows the commands issued by the administrator to manage the knowledge repository.

-   **Knowledge Feedback:** This flow shows the feedback provided by a medical device systems engineer on the knowledge retrieved from the repository. This feedback loop allows for improvement of the knowledge repository over time.

```{=html}
<!--
The SysML internal block diagram provides a high-level overview of the knowledge repository system for medical device systems engineering knowledge. It shows the system's components, the users who interact with it, and the types of information that flow through the system.

Here are some additional points to consider:

- The specific types of knowledge that will be stored in the repository.
- The mechanisms for searching and retrieving knowledge from the repository.
- The security measures that will be in place to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the knowledge in the repository.
- The way in which the knowledge repository will be kept up-to-date with the latest standards and regulations.
