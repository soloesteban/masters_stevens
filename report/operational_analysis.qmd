The Operational Analysis perspective analyses the issue of operational users (actors), by identifying stakeholders that have to interact with the system, their goals, activities, constraints and the interaction conditions between them. This perspective allows to model the required high-level operational capabilities and perform an operational needs analysis without even defining the system-of-interest, in fact the system may not even mentioned in this section [@cronin].

### Knowledge Repository

The core element of the system is the **Knowledge Repository** block. This block represents a database or information storage system that houses the medical device systems engineering knowledge base. The knowledge base is comprised of multiple **Content** elements, indicated by the notation "\[1..\*\]". This multiplicity signifies that the repository must contain at least one content element, and the number of content elements can be limitless. The content would likely encompasses details about regulatory, risk management, requirements management, and other relevant medical device systems engineering information.

The knowledge repository also includes a **Search Engine** component. This component plays a critical role in facilitating efficient retrieval of information from the content base. Users can leverage the search engine to locate specific knowledge items based on their needs.

The knowledge repository possesses two key properties:

-   **Maintenance Mechanism:** This property acknowledges the importance of maintaining the accuracy and completeness of the knowledge base over time. The specific mechanisms for maintenance are not explicitly shown in the diagram but could involve processes for adding, updating, and removing content.
-   **Storage:** This property refers to the physical infrastructure responsible for storing the knowledge repository. While the specific technology is not depicted, it likely involves a database server, physical medium or cloud-based storage solution.

**Interaction and Data Flow**

The diagram depicts two key data flows associated with the knowledge repository:

-   **User Interface:** This bidirectional flow signifies the interaction between users and the knowledge repository. Users can provide input, such as search queries, through the user interface. The system, in turn, can deliver output, such as search results or retrieved information, through the same channel.
-   **Knowledge Item:** This flow represents the movement of knowledge items between the knowledge repository and potentially other parts of the system or external actors. Knowledge items could be retrieved from the repository by authorized users or potentially transferred to other system components for further processing.

### Actors and System Stakeholders

The diagram identifies two primary actors that interact with the system:

-   **Administrator:** This actor plays a crucial role in managing the knowledge repository. Their responsibilities likely include adding, updating, and deleting content within the repository. Additionally, the administrator is responsible for managing access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the knowledge base.
-   **Medical Device Systems Engineer** and **Consultant:** These actors represent the primary consumers of information within the knowledge repository. They can leverage the search engine functionality to locate relevant knowledge items pertinent to their work in medical device development or consultation.

<!-- Conclusion -->

The SysML block definition diagram portrays a knowledge repository for medical device systems engineering. The repository stores and manages essential information related to medical device systems engineering. Authorized users, such as systems engineers and consultants, can access and search the repository using a search engine. An administrator maintains the knowledge base and ensures its integrity through appropriate maintenance mechanisms. This system architecture facilitates knowledge sharing and access within the medical service domain. Further analysis could explore the internal structure of the knowledge repository, including the specific data model used to represent medical service information, to gain a deeper understanding of the system's knowledge representation and retrieval capabilities.

This section analyzes a SysML sequence diagram representing the interaction between a medical device systems engineer and a knowledge repository system. @fig-main_function_sequence_diagram depicts the knowledge retrieval process crucial for informed systems engineering within the medical device development domain.

::: {#fig-main_function_sequence_diagram}
![](images/paste-4.png)

System Main Function Sequence Diagram
:::

**Actors and Interactions:**

The sequence diagram focuses on two primary actors:

-   **Medical Device Systems Engineer:** This actor represents the user of the system, an engineer seeking knowledge pertinent to medical device design or development.
-   **Knowledge Repository:** This block represents the system component housing the relevant knowledge base for medical devices.

The interaction commences with the activation of the **Medical Device Systems Engineer**. This signifies the engineer encountering a **knowledge need**, prompting them to initiate a search within the knowledge repository. The engineer transmits a request to the knowledge repository, likely specifying the desired knowledge domain or specific keywords related to their need.

**Knowledge Retrieval Process:**

Upon receiving the request, the knowledge repository executes a **Search for Knowledge Item** operation. This operation signifies the system's internal process of identifying relevant knowledge within its storage. The diagram incorporates a time constraint, indicating that the search should be completed within 10 seconds or less. This emphasizes the system's prioritization of search efficiency, ensuring timely knowledge retrieval for the engineer.

Following a successful search, the knowledge repository retrieves the identified knowledge item. This retrieved item could encompass various formats such as technical references, design guidelines, or regulatory guidelines relevant to medical devices. Finally, the knowledge repository transmits the retrieved knowledge item back to the engineer, enabling them to analyze the information and utilize it to address their specific knowledge need.

**Significance for Medical Device Development:**

This SysML sequence diagram offers a simplified yet insightful representation of a critical interaction within the medical device development process. Efficient access to relevant knowledge empowers engineers to make informed decisions concerning design, development, and regulatory compliance. The time constraint on the search operation underscores the importance of a well-structured and indexed knowledge repository, facilitating rapid retrieval of necessary information.

**Further Considerations:**

While this diagram provides a foundational understanding of the knowledge search process, further exploration could involve:

-   Investigating alternative interaction scenarios, such as browsing by category or utilizing advanced search functionalities.
-   Analyzing potential error conditions during the search process and the system's response mechanisms.
-   Considering the knowledge repository's internal structure and indexing methods for efficient retrieval.

By delving deeper into these aspects, a more comprehensive understanding of the knowledge retrieval system and its impact on informed decision-making within the medical device development domain can be achieved.
