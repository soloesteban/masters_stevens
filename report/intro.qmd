# Introduction

The field of medical device development is rapidly evolving, with advancements in technology and the growing complexity of healthcare systems. Ensuring the safety, efficacy, and compliance of medical devices is paramount to protect patient health and well-being. This project proposes the creation of a comprehensive knowledge respository that delves into the systems engineering aspects of medical device development.

## Impact

The creation of a comprehensive knowledge repository on the systems engineering of medical devices is essential to bridge the knowledge gap between engineering and healthcare, ensuring the continued development of safe and effective medical technologies. This project aims to contribute significantly to this important field, benefiting professionals, students, and the broader healthcare industry.

This system <!--(book)-->will serve as a valuable resource for:

- Systems engineers looking to specialize in medical device development.

- Healthcare professionals and clinicians seeking a deeper understanding of the engineering processes behind medical devices.

- Regulatory experts striving to align systems engineering practices with compliance requirements.

- Students and educators in systems engineering and biomedical engineering programs.
