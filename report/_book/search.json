    "text": "3.1 Systems Engineering in Medical Device Industry\nDavid M. Cronin from a company called Cognition that provides software solutions for requirements management and lifecycle management of medical devices states that for many, the phrase “systems engineering” is typically associated with large aerospace and defense companies; companies making products that are developed over many years, with long lives in the market, extremely high costs, and a relatively low total number of products manufactured. Many of these companies also employ “large,” permanent teams of systems engineers, which could be daunting to a small device company. Few device engineers are seen at conferences on systems engineering. Instead, these events include transportation, infrastructure, government, space, and of course aerospace and defense. A casual observer might think that systems engineering is not intended for the medical device industry. This is unfortunate!” (Cronin, n.d.).",

    "section": "3.3 Medical Device Regulation",
    "text": "3.3 Medical Device Regulation\nThe medical devices that are manufactured, marketed and commercialized are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device.\nIn the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of two ways (“Boston Scientific SEC Filings,” n.d.):\n\n3.3.1 Premarket Notification (510(k))\nThe premarket notification (510(k)) is made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the “predicate” device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.\n\n\n3.3.2 Premarket Approval (PMA) Application\nThe submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA demonstrates that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA may seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.",

    "section": "3.4 European Union (EU)",
    "text": "3.4 European Union (EU)\nIn the European Union (EU), it is required to comply with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR or EU MDR) which became effective in May 2021, superseding the existing Medical Device and Active Implantable Medical Device Directives. Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate (“CE Marking,” n.d.) to the prior Directives (issued before May 2021) can continue to be sold during the applicable transition period or until the CE Certificate expires, whichever comes first, providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use. The CE Mark, which is required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following a Conformity Assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification by the manufacturer. The selected pathway to CE marking is based on device risk classification. CE marking indicates conformity to the applicable General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) for the MDR. The MDR changes multiple aspects of the regulatory framework for CE marking, such as increased clinical evidence requirements, changes to labeling, and new requirements, including Unique Device Identification (UDI), and many new post-market reporting obligations. MDR also modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the medical device industry and will continue to require significant investment over the next few years to transition all products. The CE mark continues to be a prerequisite for successful registration in many other global geographies. In addition, other EU countries continue to impose significant local registration requirements despite the implementation of MDR, and the United Kingdom has introduced new requirements following its exit from the EU.\nIt is also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where the product will be commercialized before launch or maintain new products on the market, including regulations that have been introduced in many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that previously did not have medical device regulations, or had minimal regulations. In Japan, it is required to comply with Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) regulations. In conjunction with the MHLW, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency is an independent agency that is responsible for reviewing drug and medical device applications and works with the MHLW to assess new product safety, develop comprehensive regulations, and monitor post-market safety.\nThe FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order recall or market withdrawal of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act, pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where business is done can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.\nInternational sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAccording to Webinar Applications of Systems Engineering in Healthcare, lead by Chris Unger, Ph.D. ESEP of GE Healthcare and Vincent Balgos of Jama Software, some challenges faced by the medical device industry:\n\nConstant time pressure launching safe and effective products\n\n~70% of medical products are delivered late.\nTime to define requirements has increased 29% and unplanned requirements churn has increased 81%.\n\nShifting regulatory landscape\n\nE.g., Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), Software in a Medical Device (SiMD), Medical Device Regulation (MDR), In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), etc.\nCost of adherence and impact on business strategy.\n\nQuality issues represent significant financial impact\n\nNon-routine quality events cost the industry between $2.5 and $5 billion per year on average.\nOn average, one company per year has seen a 10% drop in share price after a single, major quality event.\n\nConstant increasing complexity, particularly with software\n\nSoftware has become the biggest cause of medical device recalls.\nE.g., The global artificial intelligence/machine learning medical device market was an estimated $4 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $35.5 billion by 2032.\nE.g., Remote patient monitoring market was valued at $2.1 billion in 2022 and expected to reach $8.1 by 2030.\nIncreasing risk of cybersecurity concerns.\n\nHeavy focus on acquisition and geographically distributed development teams\n\nE.g., The medical devices sector in Q2 2023 witnessed deals worth $33 billion, a growth of 42% compared to Q1 2023 and 87% compared to Q2 2022.",

A seamless integration of the design and development process and the safety risk management process will allow devices to be safety used on humans. The development process is described in ISO 13485, the international standard for the development of medical devices. ISO 14971 is the international standard for the evaluation of the safety risk of a medical device. Universities and companies hoping to use their devices in clinical trials on patients are required to follow a well-defined process incorporating design and development planning, design input, design output, design review, design verification, and design validation (Wehde 2020).",

As a result, there has been a noticeable growth in the number of books and resources dedicated to medical devices . Topics covered in these books may include regulatory compliance, risk management, quality assurance, and design principles tailored to medical devices. But there is very few books on systems engineering for medical devices.\nSystems engineering is a broad discipline applied across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, defense, telecommunications, and more. Therefore, there are numerous books available on systems engineering principles, methods, and applications in these fields.\nThe number of books on systems engineering of medical devices is fewer in comparison to those covering systems engineering in more established industries.",

    "text": "6.2 Problem modeled as a casual loop\n\nFigure 6.1 is a diagram of a causal loop (Sterman and Sterman 2000) that shows a system where investment in systems engineering yields positive results. The diagram shows that increased profits can lead to more resources for better systems engineering which help reduce unsuccessful medical devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Problem modeled as a casual loop\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the Causal Loop in the Image:\nAn explanation of the elements that make up the casual loop is given as follows:\n\nUnsuccessful Medical Devices (U) –&gt; Decreased Profits (P) (Negative) - Unsuccessful devices lead to lower sales and profitability.\nProfits (P) –&gt; Resources for Systems Engineering (SE) (Positive) - More profits allow for more investment in systems engineering.\nUnderstanding of Systems Engineering (SE) –&gt; Decreased Unsuccessful Medical Devices (U) (Negative) - Better understanding of systems engineering leads to fewer poorly designed devices. If there’s a lack of understanding of systems engineering principles among stakeholders in the medical device industry, it can lead to ineffective utilization or implementation of systems engineering methodologies in the development process.\nResources for Systems Engineering (SE) –&gt; Improved Understanding of Systems Engineering (SE) (Positive) - More resources dedicated to systems engineering education improves understanding.\n\nFeedback Loops:\n\nBalancing Loop (B): This loop discourages unsuccessful devices. As unsuccessful devices (U) increase, profits (P) decrease. This decrease in profits (P) leads to fewer resources for systems engineering (SE). Less resources for systems engineering (SE) leads to a poorer understanding of systems engineering (SE), which ultimately leads to more unsuccessful devices (U). This loop creates pressure to improve systems engineering practices to break the cycle of unsuccessful devices.\n\nKey Points:\n\nThe diagram shows a reinforcing cycle (B) that discourages unsuccessful devices. This is because better understanding of systems engineering leads to fewer unsuccessful devices, which increases profits, which allows for more investment in systems engineering, and so on.\nLow adoption of systems engineering results in ineffective medical device development processes. Without proper systems engineering practices, the development processes may lack holistic consideration of all system components, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delays.\nIneffective development processes can contribute to increased incidents of device failures. Without robust systems engineering practices, there’s a higher likelihood of design flaws, inadequate testing, and safety issues in medical devices, leading to higher failure rates and potential harm to patients.",

Class III devices are considered the highest risk, while Class I devices are considered the lowest risk (Health and Radiological 2023).\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Implantable versus non-implantable\nFigure 8.3 is a line graph that shows the percentage of implantable and non-implantable medical devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Proportion of Implantable vs. Non-Implantable Medical Devices Registered with the FDA (as of February 1, 2024)\n\n\n\nThe data shows that as of February 1, 2024, implantable medical devices make up a smaller percentage of registered devices than non-implantable devices.\nImplantable medical devices are devices that are inserted into the body for a long period of time. Examples of implantable medical devices include pacemakers, artificial hips, and breast implants. Non-implantable medical devices are devices that are used on the body but are not inserted into it. Examples of non-implantable medical devices include stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, and bandages.\n\n\n8.3.3 Medical Specialties\nFigure 8.4 shows the distribution of FDA-registered medical devices by medical specialty, based on FDA product codes, as of February 1, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Distribution of FDA-Registered Medical Devices by Medical Specialty (as of February 1, 2024)\n\n\n\nHere’s what we can gleaned from the chart:\n\nSpecialties with the most devices: The specialties with the highest percentage of registered devices are:\n\nOrthopedic\nGeneral and Plastic Surgery\nCardiovascular\nGeneral Hospital\n\nSpecialties with the least devices: The specialties with the lowest percentage of registered devices are:\n\nClinical Toxicology\nImmunology\nMicrobiology\nClinical Chemistry\nHematology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe number of devices registered in a particular specialty doesn’t necessarily reflect the number of procedures performed in that specialty. For example, there may be a relatively small number of complex orthopedic devices compared to the number of simple bandages used in wound care, but both would be classified under orthopedic devices.\n\n\nSome reasons why some specialties might have more devices than others:\n\nSurgical specialties: Surgical specialties tend to have a wider variety of devices because they use devices for a variety of procedures.\nChronic conditions: Specialties that treat chronic conditions may have a wider variety of devices because they may use devices to monitor or treat the condition over time.\n\n\n\n8.3.4 FDA Product Code\nFigure 8.5 is word cloud that highlights the most frequent terms from FDA Product Codes of registered devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Most frequent FDA Product Codes Terms of the registered devices (as of February 1, 2024)\n\n\n\nBased on the word cloud, the most frequent FDA Product Code Terms for registered medical devices with the FDA as of February 1, 2024:\n\nSurgical\nTracheostomy\nCardiovascular\nWireless\nSynthetic\nAdult\nCervical\nSpinal\nElectrode\nPlastic\n\nIt appears that surgical devices and those used in cardiology are the most common.

Structure and Documentation:\n\nRequirement management and documentation tools provide a framework to record decisions and trace how activities meet requirements. This ensures traceability and simplifies demonstrating compliance with regulations. (Example: “Cockpit is used to navigate, trace and clearly understand our requirements and source/rationale”)\n\n2. Collaboration and Communication:\n\nCollaboration tools are essential for communication within the team and across disciplines. They facilitate information dissemination and decision making throughout the development process. (Example: “Collaboration and communication is key for Systems engineering. Tools that help facilitate communication and the system’s boundaries are critical.”)\n\n3. Information Management:\n\nData analysis and visualization tools, version control systems, and quality management systems help gather information, keep it up-to-date, and create a clear picture of the project’s status. (Example: “It’s the only way to create a complete picture of product design requirements, risks, and tests.”)\n\n4. Specific Needs of Medical Device Development:\n\nSome engineers highlighted the importance of tools tailored to medical device development, such as FMEA for risk management. (Example: “As a Design Assurance Engineer, I focus on communication/collaboration tools, project management software (JIRA), and requirements management (JAMA).”)\n\n5. Balancing Functionality with Efficiency:\n\nWhile some emphasized the importance of powerful tools like Matlab, others stressed that tools should not become a hindrance and should prioritize getting the job done efficiently. (Example: “Overall, they help in getting the job done without being a hinderance.”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe responses suggest a preference for familiar and widely used tools like Microsoft Office suite alongside more specialized engineering tools.\nThere’s a recognition that the “best” tools depend on the specific role and project within medical device systems engineering.",

    "text": "9.5 Question 5\n\nCould you please provide insights into why you find the selected methodologies valuable in your day-to-day work as a systems engineer for medical devices? Describe the outcomes or benefits you’ve experienced by employing these methodologies. Additionally, if applicable, mention any alternative methodologies that were considered but not chosen, and the rationale behind your selection.\n\nFigure 9.5 is word cloud of question 5 results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Question 5 results\n\n\n\n\nThe follow-up survey question provided valuable insights into why specific methodologies are beneficial for systems engineers working on medical devices. Here’s a breakdown of the key themes:\n1. Emphasis on Requirements and System Definition:\n\nThe system engineers highlighted the importance of methodologies like requirements engineering and model-based approaches (MBSE). These methodologies ensure a clear understanding of what the system needs to do and how it will function, leading to fewer rework loops and more efficient development. (Example: “Don’t know, what are my choices? have to get the requirements correct and properly scoped… Model-based approaches allow better insight into how the system might behave…”)\n\n2. Communication and Collaboration:\n\nThe critical role of cross-disciplinary collaboration was emphasized. Methodologies that facilitate communication across teams (e.g., engineering, design, user experience) are essential for developing a cohesive medical device. (Example: “Cross-disciplinary collaboration is at the heart of what I do - nothing sticks if there isn’t full understanding and agreement…”)\n\n3. Risk Management and Safety:\n\nQuality and compliance methodologies (e.g., FMEA, HACCP (Nutrition and Applied 2024)) were considered valuable for managing risks and ensuring the device meets regulatory requirements. (Example: “These are either required or the most efficient approaches to getting work completed. Procedures and systems drive these tools more than others…”)\n\n4. Specific Needs of Medical Devices:\n\nSome system engineers pointed out that some methodologies, like Human Factors and Usability are particularly important for medical devices due to the focus on user safety and interaction. (Example: “Human Factors and Usability - reports on things like formative studies are important to have in documenting requirement rationale.”)\n\n5. Balancing Efficiency and Innovation:\n\nWhile engineering practices and established methodologies are crucial, some mentioned the potential benefits of agile methods for flexibility and adapting to changing requirements. (Example: “Agile methods are highly effective in helping to focus on the highest value first, preventing scope creep and supporting a ‘fail fast’ mindset.”)\n\n6. Regulatory Considerations:\n\nA few responses suggested that regulatory requirements should not solely dictate the chosen methodologies. However, a well-defined systems engineering approach can facilitate regulatory compliance. (Example: “Again, many of processes listed did not strike me as medical device specific. I also think regulatory should not drive systems engineering but good systems engineering should deliver what you need to get the product approved in many cases.”)",

    "text": "9.7 Question 7\n\nPlease indicate which job roles, in your opinion, possess a good understanding of the deliverables and artifacts produced by systems engineers?\n\n\nFigure 9.7 is a word cloud of question 7 results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Question 7 results\n\n\n\nThe overlap between the two most frequently mentioned job roles in both surveys is interesting. Here’s a breakdown of the findings:\n\nProject Managers (13 respondents in the previous survey and 8 respondents in the follow-up question) continue to be identified as a key role that understands the deliverables and artifacts produced by systems engineers. This highlights the importance of their role in overseeing the entire project lifecycle and ensuring systems engineers’ work aligns with project goals.\n\nHere are some other insights from the follow-up question:\n\nQuality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) Engineers (14 respondents in the previous survey and 9 respondents in the follow-up question) are likely involved in the verification and validation processes of medical devices, making them familiar with the systems engineering deliverables needed to ensure quality.\nRegulatory Affairs Specialists (9 respondents in the previous survey and 3 respondents in the follow-up question) understand the regulatory requirements that systems engineers consider throughout the design process.\n\nThe follow-up question also highlights some roles that may benefit from a stronger understanding of systems engineering deliverables:\n\nSoftware Engineers (15 respondents in the previous survey and 5 respondents in the follow-up question) collaborate frequently with systems engineers, but their understanding of deliverables might be limited depending on their area of focus within the software development process.\nElectrical and Mechanical Engineers (24 respondents in the previous survey and 2 respondents in the follow-up question) could benefit from a clear understanding of the system-level design considerations provided by systems engineers.\n\nOverall, the survey results suggest that while some roles naturally have a better understanding of systems engineers’ deliverables due to close collaboration (e.g., project managers, QA/QC engineers), there’s an opportunity to improve communication and knowledge sharing across disciplines (e.g., software engineers, design engineers). This can enhance overall collaboration and ensure everyone involved has a clear understanding of how their work contributes to the medical device development process.",

    "section": "12.2 Operational Scenarios",
    "text": "12.2 Operational Scenarios\nThe operational scenarios are created to demonstrate the use cases can be satisfied (validation).\n\n12.2.1 Main System Operational Scenario\n\nThis section analyzes a SysML sequence diagram representing the interaction between a medical device systems engineer and a knowledge repository system. Figure 12.5 depicts the knowledge retrieval process crucial for informed systems engineering within the medical device development domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: System Main Function Sequence Diagram\n\n\n\nActors and Interactions:\nThe sequence diagram focuses on two primary actors:\n\nMedical Device Systems Engineer: This actor represents the user of the system, an engineer seeking knowledge pertinent to medical device design or development.\nKnowledge Repository: This block represents the system component housing the relevant knowledge for medical device systems engineering.\n\nThe interaction commences with the activation of the Medical Device Systems Engineer. This signifies the engineer encountering a knowledge need, prompting them to initiate a search within the knowledge repository. The engineer transmits a request to the knowledge repository, likely specifying the desired knowledge domain or specific keywords related to their need.\nKnowledge Retrieval Process:\nUpon receiving the request, the knowledge repository executes a Search for Knowledge Item operation. This operation signifies the system’s internal process of identifying relevant knowledge within its storage. The diagram incorporates a time constraint, indicating that the search should be completed within 10 seconds or less. This emphasizes the system’s prioritization of search efficiency, ensuring timely knowledge retrieval for the engineer.\nFollowing a successful search, the knowledge repository retrieves the identified knowledge item. This retrieved item could encompass various formats such as technical references, design guidelines, or regulatory guidelines relevant to medical devices. Finally, the knowledge repository transmits the retrieved knowledge item back to the engineer, enabling them to analyze the information and utilize it to address their specific knowledge need.\nSignificance for Medical Device Development:\nThis SysML sequence diagram offers a simplified yet insightful representation of a critical interaction within the medical device development process. Efficient access to relevant knowledge empowers engineers to make informed decisions concerning design, development, and regulatory compliance. The time constraint on the search operation underscores the importance of a well-structured and indexed knowledge repository, facilitating rapid retrieval of necessary information.\nFurther Considerations:\nWhile this diagram provides a foundational understanding of the knowledge search process, further exploration could involve:\n\nInvestigating alternative interaction scenarios, such as browsing by category or utilizing advanced search functionalities.\nAnalyzing potential error conditions during the search process and the system’s response mechanisms.\nConsidering the knowledge repository’s internal structure and indexing methods for efficient retrieval.\n\nBy delving deeper into these aspects, a more comprehensive understanding of the knowledge retrieval system and its impact on informed decision-making within the medical device development domain can be achieved.\n\n\n12.2.2 Browse Knowledge Operational Scenarios\n\n12.2.2.1 Browse Knowledge Base (Actor: Medical Device Systems Engineer)\nFigure 12.6 depicts the interaction between a Medical Device Systems Engineer (MDSE) and a Knowledge Repository system during the browsing of knowledge base entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: SysML Sequence Diagram: Browse Knowledge Base (MDSE)\n\n\n\nThe message sequence is the following:\n\nMDSE Activates System: The MDSE initiates the interaction by activating the Knowledge Repository system, likely by launching the application or visiting a website.\nSystem Provides Browse Options: The Knowledge Repository system responds by presenting the MDSE with browse options. These options might include browsing by category, topic, or keyword search.\nMDSE Selects Browse Option: The MDSE selects a desired browse option. In this specific diagram, the option chosen is to browse by category.\nSystem Sends Category List: The Knowledge Repository system sends a list of available categories to the MDSE.\nMDSE Selects Category: The MDSE selects a category of interest from the list provided by the system.\nSystem Sends Knowledge Base Entries: The Knowledge Repository system retrieves knowledge base entries matching the selected category and sends them to the MDSE.\nMDSE Reviews Entries: The MDSE reviews the list of knowledge base entries provided by the system. This might involve reading titles, descriptions, or summaries to determine if the entries are relevant to the MDSE’s needs.\n(Optional) MDSE Selects Entry: If an entry is of particular interest, the MDSE might select it for further exploration (e.g., clicking on an article title to view its details).\n\nThe diagram highlights the key interactions:\n\nThe system offers various browse options, allowing the MDSE to navigate the knowledge base efficiently based on their needs.\nFiltering by category provides a structured approach to exploring the knowledge base.\nThe ability to review entry details empowers the MDSE to assess the relevance of each entry before potentially diving deeper.\n\n\n\n12.2.2.2 Search Knowledge Base (Actor: Medical Device Systems Engineer)\nFigure 12.7 is a SysML sequence diagram that illustrates the interaction when the MDSE utilizes the optional “Search Knowledge Base” functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: Knowledge Repository Search Functionality - SysML Sequence Diagram\n\n\n\nThe MDSE activates the system and initiates the “Search Knowledge Base” use case. The Knowledge Base System prompts the MDSE to enter search keywords, after which the MDSE enters the keywords. The system then searches the knowledge base based on the entered keywords and displays the search results to the MDSE. Optionally, the MDSE can interact with the displayed search results.\nHere’s a breakdown of the interaction:\n\nThe diagram starts with the engineer initiating the search for knowledge (Initiate_Search_Knowledge()).\nThe system prompts the engineer to enter search keywords (Prompt_to_enter_search_keywords()).\nThe engineer enters the search keywords (Enter_search_keywords())\nThe system utilizes the entered keywords to search the knowledge base (Search_knowledge_base())\nOnce the search is complete, the system displays the search results (Display_search_results())\nOptionally, the engineer can interact with the search results (Interact_with_search_results()) which likely involves further refining the search or selecting specific results for detailed viewing.\n\n\n\n\n12.2.2.3 Filter Knowledge Base by Category (Actor: Medical Device Systems Engineer)\nFigure 12.8 is a SysML sequence diagram that captures the step-by-step interaction between the MDSE and the Knowledge Base System during the process of filtering knowledge base entries by category. It begins with the MDSE activating the system and initiating the filtering use case. The Knowledge Base System then presents a list of available categories, allowing the MDSE to make a selection. Upon selecting a category, the system retrieves and displays the corresponding knowledge base entries. Finally, the MDSE has the option to interact with the displayed entries as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Sequence Diagram: Filter Knowledge Base by Category (Actor: Medical Device Systems Engineer)\n\n\n\nMessages:\n\nMDSE activates the system and initiates the “Filter Knowledge Base by Category” use case:\n\nThe MDSE triggers the filtering process by activating the system, indicating the intent to filter the knowledge base entries based on a specific category.\n\nKnowledge Base System presents a list of available categories to the MDSE:\n\nUpon activation, the Knowledge Base System responds by presenting a list of available categories to the MDSE.\nThis message indicates the system’s readiness to receive input from the MDSE regarding the desired category for filtering.\n\nMDSE selects a category from the list:\n\nThe MDSE selects a category from the presented list, specifying the criteria for filtering the knowledge base entries.\nThis interaction allows the MDSE to narrow down the search scope to retrieve relevant information.\n\nKnowledge Base System retrieves and displays knowledge base entries belonging to the selected category:\n\nUpon receiving the selected category from the MDSE, the Knowledge Base System retrieves and displays the knowledge base entries that correspond to the specified category.\nThis message signifies the system’s action of processing the MDSE’s request and presenting the filtered results accordingly.\n\nMDSE (Optional): MDSE can interact with the displayed entries:\n\nOptionally, the MDSE can interact with the displayed knowledge base entries to further analyze, review, or utilize the information.\nThis interaction provides flexibility to the MDSE in exploring the filtered results based on their specific requirements or preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.3 Contribute Knowledge Operational Scenario\n\n\n\n12.2.4 Manage Knowledge Operational Scenario\n\n12.2.4.1 Update Content\n\nFigure 12.9 is a SysML sequence diagram that focuses on the use case, “Manage Knowledge,” identified in Figure 12.4 from the Administrator Perspective. It illustrates the interaction between the Administrator and the MDSE-KR System for adding a new content entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Update Content Sequence Diagram\n\n\n\n\nElements:\n\nActors:\n\nMDSE-KR Administrator\n\nLifelines: Vertical dashed lines representing the actors and the system.\nSystem: MDSE-KR System\nMessages: Arrows depicting the interaction flow between the Administrator and the System.\n\nMessage Sequence:\n\nAdministrator: Activates the system by initiating the “Add Content Entry” functionality.\nKnowledge Repository: Sends a message to the Administrator requesting details for the new entry. This might involve title, description, category selection, and potentially file upload options.\nAdministrator: Provides the required information for the new entry.\nKnowledge Repository: Validates the information provided by the Administrator. This could involve checking for missing fields or ensuring compliance with formatting guidelines.\nKnowledge Repository (Success): If validation is successful, the system stores the new entry in the knowledge base and sends a confirmation message to the Administrator.\nKnowledge Repository (Failure): If validation fails, the system sends an error message to the Administrator explaining the issue and requesting corrections.\nAdministrator (Success): The Administrator acknowledges the confirmation message (optional).\nAdministrator (Failure): The Administrator reviews the error message, makes necessary changes to the entry details, and repeats steps 3-8.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.5 Manage Access Control Operational Scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nCronin, David M. n.d. “Accelerate Medical Device Development with Systems Engineering.” https://blog.cognition.us/medical-product-development-systems-engineering.",
