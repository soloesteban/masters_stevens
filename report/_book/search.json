    "text": "3.1 Systems Engineering in Medical Device Industry\nDavid M. Cronin from a company called Cognition that provides software solutions for requirements management and lifecycle management of medical devices states that for many, the phrase “systems engineering” is typically associated with large aerospace and defense companies; companies making products that are developed over many years, with long lives in the market, extremely high costs, and a relatively low total number of products manufactured. Many of these companies also employ “large,” permanent teams of systems engineers, which could be daunting to a small device company. Few device engineers are seen at conferences on systems engineering. Instead, these events include transportation, infrastructure, government, space, and of course aerospace and defense. A casual observer might think that systems engineering is not intended for the medical device industry. This is unfortunate!” (Cronin, n.d.).",

    "section": "3.3 Medical Device Regulation",
    "text": "3.3 Medical Device Regulation\nThe medical devices that are manufactured, marketed and commercializeed are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device.\nIn the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of two ways (“Boston Scientific SEC Filings,” n.d.):\n\nThe first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the “predicate” device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.\nThe second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA may seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.\n\nIn the European Union (EU), it is required to comply with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR or EU MDR) which became effective in May 2021, superseding the existing Medical Device and Active Implantable Medical Device Directives. Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the prior Directives (issued before May 2021) can continue to be sold during the applicable transition period or until the CE Certificate expires, whichever comes first, providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use. The CE Mark, which is required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following a Conformity Assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification by the manufacturer. The selected pathway to CE marking is based on device risk classification. CE marking indicates conformity to the applicable General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) for the MDR. The MDR changes multiple aspects of the regulatory framework for CE marking, such as increased clinical evidence requirements, changes to labelling, and new requirements, including Unique Device Identification (UDI), and many new post-market reporting obligations. MDR also modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the medical device industry and will continue to require significant investment over the next few years to transition all products. The CE mark continues to be a prerequisite for successful registration in many other global geographies. In addition, other EU countries continue to impose significant local registration requirements despite the implementation of MDR, and the United Kingdom has introduced new requirements following its exit from the EU.\nIt is also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where the product will be commercialized before launch or maintain new products on the market, including regulations that have been introduced in many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that previously did not have medical device regulations, or had minimal regulations. In Japan, it is required to comply with Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) regulations. In conjunction with the MHLW, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency is an independent agency that is responsible for reviewing drug and medical device applications and works with the MHLW to assess new product safety, develop comprehensive regulations, and monitor post-market safety.\nThe FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order recall or market withdrawal of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act, pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where business is done can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.\nInternational sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported.",

As unsuccessful devices (U) increase, profits (P) decrease. This decrease in profits (P) leads to fewer resources for systems engineering (SE). Less resources for systems engineering (SE) leads to a poorer understanding of systems engineering (SE), which ultimately leads to more unsuccessful devices (U). This loop creates pressure to improve systems engineering practices to break the cycle of unsuccessful devices.\n\nKey Points:\n\nThe diagram shows a reinforcing cycle (B) that discourages unsuccessful devices. This is because better understanding of systems engineering leads to fewer unsuccessful devices, which increases profits, which allows for more investment in systems engineering, and so on.\nLow adoption of systems engineering results in ineffective medical device development processes. Without proper systems engineering practices, the development processes may lack holistic consideration of all system components, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delays.\nIneffective development processes can contribute to increased incidents of device failures. Without robust systems engineering practices, there’s a higher likelihood of design flaws, inadequate testing, and safety issues in medical devices, leading to higher failure rates and potential harm to patients.",

Figure 10.2 depicts the knowledge retrieval process crucial for informed systems engineering within the medical device development domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: System Main Function Sequence Diagram\n\n\n\nActors and Interactions:\nThe sequence diagram focuses on two primary actors:\n\nMedical Device Systems Engineer: This actor represents the user of the system, an engineer seeking knowledge pertinent to medical device design or development.\nKnowledge Repository: This block represents the system component housing the relevant knowledge base for medical devices.\n\nThe interaction commences with the activation of the Medical Device Systems Engineer. This signifies the engineer encountering a knowledge need, prompting them to initiate a search within the knowledge repository. The engineer transmits a request to the knowledge repository, likely specifying the desired knowledge domain or specific keywords related to their need.\nKnowledge Retrieval Process:\nUpon receiving the request, the knowledge repository executes a Search for Knowledge Item operation. This operation signifies the system’s internal process of identifying relevant knowledge within its storage. The diagram incorporates a time constraint, indicating that the search should be completed within 10 seconds or less. This emphasizes the system’s prioritization of search efficiency, ensuring timely knowledge retrieval for the engineer.\nFollowing a successful search, the knowledge repository retrieves the identified knowledge item. This retrieved item could encompass various formats such as technical references, design guidelines, or regulatory guidelines relevant to medical devices. Finally, the knowledge repository transmits the retrieved knowledge item back to the engineer, enabling them to analyze the information and utilize it to address their specific knowledge need.\nSignificance for Medical Device Development:\nThis SysML sequence diagram offers a simplified yet insightful representation of a critical interaction within the medical device development process. Efficient access to relevant knowledge empowers engineers to make informed decisions concerning design, development, and regulatory compliance. The time constraint on the search operation underscores the importance of a well-structured and indexed knowledge repository, facilitating rapid retrieval of necessary information.\nFurther Considerations:\nWhile this diagram provides a foundational understanding of the knowledge search process, further exploration could involve:\n\nInvestigating alternative interaction scenarios, such as browsing by category or utilizing advanced search functionalities.\nAnalyzing potential error conditions during the search process and the system’s response mechanisms.\nConsidering the knowledge repository’s internal structure and indexing methods for efficient retrieval.\n\nBy delving deeper into these aspects, a more comprehensive understanding of the knowledge retrieval system and its impact on informed decision-making within the medical device development domain can be achieved.\n\n\n10.2.2 Browse Knowledge Operational Scenario\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Search Knowledge Operational Scenario\n\n\n\n10.2.4 Contribute Knowledge Operational Scenario\n\n\n\n10.2.5 Update Knowledge Operational Scenario\nFigure 10.3 is a sequence diagram demonstrates a simplified content update process within the knowledge repository system. It highlights the interaction between the engineer and the knowledge repository, but doesn’t show details like content format validation or error handling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Update Content Sequence Diagram\n\n\n\nThe image depicts a SysML sequence diagram for updating content in the knowledge repository system. The diagram showcases the interaction between a medical device systems engineer and the knowledge repository.\nHere’s a breakdown of the interaction sequence:\n\nThe medical device systems engineer initiates the update process by calling the initiateUpdate() function.\nThe knowledge repository receives the initiateUpdate() call and responds with the updateContent(content) function, prompting the engineer to provide the new content.\nThe engineer provides the content through the updateContent(content) function call.\nThe knowledge repository then performs the saveContent() function to store the updated content.\nAfter successful update, the knowledge repository sends a confirmation message through the updateSuccessful() function.\n\n\n\n10.2.6 Manage Access Control Operational Scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nCronin, David M. n.d. “Accelerate Medical Device Development with Systems Engineering.” https://blog.cognition.us/medical-product-development-systems-engineering.",
