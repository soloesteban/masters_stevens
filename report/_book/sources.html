<p><a href="#fig-sources_needs_requirements" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>8.1</span></a> is a SysML block definition diagram that shows the sources of needs and requirements for designing a MedSE knowledge repository.

<p>The diagram lists valid (credible) sources:</p>

<p>The number of devices registered in a particular specialty doesn’t necessarily reflect the number of procedures performed in that specialty. For example, there may be a relatively small number of complex orthopedic devices compared to the number of simple bandages used in wound care, but both would be classified under orthopedic devices.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some reasons why some specialties might have more devices than others:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Surgical specialties:</strong> Surgical specialties tend to have a wider variety of devices because they use devices for a variety of procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chronic conditions:</strong> Specialties that treat chronic conditions may have a wider variety of devices because they may use devices to monitor or treat the condition over time.</p></li>

Systems Perspective Engineering : A webinar on Medical Device product development

Aug 24, 2020
Usability engineering can be viewed as a product lifecycle process and can be effectively integrated with an overall systems engineering approach.

 When viewed with this systems perspective, we see users and their needs, environments, constraints, and risks as part of the product or device under development.

 In this session, participants will explore this systems perspective on usability engineering and how it can be integrated in an overall development process. 

About our Speakers: Katie McHugh, Lead Systems Engineer, MPR Associates, Inc. Kathleen McHugh is a project manager and lead systems engineer with over 15 years of experience designing a wide variety of medical device systems. Her experience ranges from low-cost single use devices to complex, electromechanical systems for both hospital and home use. As the leader of MPR's systems engineering center of excellence, Kathleen has a particular focus on project management, systems engineering, usability and risk management processes.

<p>A webinar titled “Systems Perspective Engineering : A webinar on Medical Device product development” discussed how usability engineering can be integrated into the systems engineering process for medical device development.</p>
<div class="quarto-video"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_Eh-VEm55E" width="400" height="300" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>From this webinar, the MedSE knowledge repository should incorporate the following key points:</p>
<p><strong>Usability Engineering Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iterative process applied throughout development.</li>
<li>Complements design control and risk management.</li>
<li>Follows IEC 62366 and FDA guidance.</li>
<li>Involves user research, task analysis, risk analysis, formative evaluations, and summative validation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Systems Engineering Approach (V Model):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starts with understanding user needs and defining requirements.</li>
<li>Breaks down the system into manageable pieces.</li>
<li>Focuses on mitigating technical risks early.</li>
<li>Integrates different disciplines throughout development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Integrate Usability into Systems Engineering?</strong> * Usability is a project-level risk that should be mitigated early. * Usability engineering tools complement the V model. * Early integration reduces design risk and rework later.</p>
<p><strong>Who Owns Usability?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, the systems engineer due to their focus on mitigating risks.</li>
<li>Can be someone else with influence to plan and integrate usability activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usability Engineering Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Should be planned early and scaled based on device risk.</li>
<li>Defines the types of evaluations and resources needed throughout development.</li>
<li>Integrates usability activities throughout all development phases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Reducing Usability Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider usability risk mitigation early in system architecture planning.</li>
<li>Shift usability evaluation of critical hardware subsystems earlier.</li>
<li>Evaluate software user interfaces before coding and implementation.</li>
<li>Develop instructions for use and training as subsystems to be iterated on.</li>
<li>Strategically sequence development of features based on usability risk.</li>
<li>Plan ahead for materials and control of devices for usability studies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additionally, the webinar covered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Examples of usability engineering tools used throughout the development process.</li>
<li>How to develop a usability engineering plan.</li>
<li>How to conduct usability studies at different development phases.</li>

<p>This section dives into the insights gleaned from a survey conducted in April 2024. The survey targeted systems engineers working in the field of medical device development. The survey received responses from a diverse group of professionals from leading companies including Boston Scientific, the FDA, Nudge BG, BIOTRONIK, and others. The primary objective of this survey was to identify the knowledge and resources that are most valuable to medical device systems engineers in their daily work.</p>
<p>The analysis of the survey responses was aimed to inform the development of the MedSE knowledge repository.</p>
<p>The following section will present a detailed analysis of the survey findings.<!--Explore the  methodologies, tools, and regulations  considered most valuable by medical device systems engineers.  We will also examine the learning formats they find most accessible and beneficial  for  professional development. These insights will guide the content selection and structure of the knowledge repository, ensuring it effectively addresses the needs and preferences of its target audience.--></p>
<p>For reference, the template used for the survey questions is included in <a href="./survey.html">Appendix Survey</a> of this report. This will allow readers to gain a deeper understanding of the specific questions asked and the context surrounding the survey responses.</p>
