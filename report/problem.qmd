## Problem Statement

```{=html}
<!--
Describe the problem that is being addressed here
-->
```
In recent years, the field of medical device systems engineering has gained significant attention due to the increasing complexity of medical devices and the rigorous regulatory requirements they must meet. As a result, there has been a noticeable growth in the number of books and resources dedicated to medical devices <!--this specialized area of systems engineering-->. Topics covered in these books may include regulatory compliance, risk management, quality assurance, and design principles tailored to medical devices. But there is very few books on systems engineering for medical devices.

<!--On the other hand,-->

Systems engineering is a broad discipline applied across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, defense, telecommunications, and more. Therefore, there are numerous books available on systems engineering principles, methods, and applications in these fields.

The number of books on systems engineering of medical devices is fewer in comparison to those covering systems engineering in more established industries.

### Problem from the perspective of non-systems engineers

Lack of a clear understanding of what is systems engineering of medical devices:

-   Colleagues and senior leadership aren’t clear…<!--this statement is being supported by the survey results on which dicisplines understand the systems engineering deliverables-->
-   If it is ‘requirements’ (or even models), why does that add value?
-   Medical Device Systems Engineering can look like more paperwork (or more modeling work)
-   And have a separate function? Why not hire more software and hardware people “who actually deliver things the customer uses”?

### Problem from the perspective of systems engineers

Medical Device Systems Engineers don't seem to agree what it is…but everyone seems sure they know and are right.

## Problem modeled as a casual loop

@fig-casual_loop is a diagram of a causal loop [@sterman2000] that shows a system where investment in systems engineering yields positive results. The diagram shows that increased profits can lead to more resources for better systems engineering which help reduce unsuccessful medical devices.

Problem modeled as a casual loop
:::

**Analysis of the Causal Loop in the Image:**

An explanation of the elements that make up the casual loop is given as follows:

-   **Unsuccessful Medical Devices (U)** --\> **Decreased Profits (P)** (Negative) - Unsuccessful devices lead to lower sales and profitability.

-   **Profits (P)** --\> **Resources for Systems Engineering (SE)** (Positive) - More profits allow for more investment in systems engineering.

-   **Understanding of Systems Engineering (SE)** --\> **Decreased Unsuccessful Medical Devices (U)** (Negative) - Better understanding of systems engineering leads to fewer poorly designed devices. If there's a lack of understanding of systems engineering principles among stakeholders in the medical device industry, it can lead to ineffective utilization or implementation of systems engineering methodologies in the development process.

-   **Resources for Systems Engineering (SE)** --\> **Improved Understanding of Systems Engineering (SE)** (Positive) - More resources dedicated to systems engineering education improves understanding.

**Feedback Loops:**

-   **Balancing Loop (B):** This loop discourages unsuccessful devices. As unsuccessful devices (U) increase, profits (P) decrease. This decrease in profits (P) leads to fewer resources for systems engineering (SE). Less resources for systems engineering (SE) leads to a poorer understanding of systems engineering (SE), which ultimately leads to more unsuccessful devices (U). This loop creates pressure to improve systems engineering practices to break the cycle of unsuccessful devices.

**Key Points:**

-   The diagram shows a reinforcing cycle (B) that discourages unsuccessful devices. This is because better understanding of systems engineering leads to fewer unsuccessful devices, which increases profits, which allows for more investment in systems engineering, and so on.

-   Low adoption of systems engineering results in ineffective medical device development processes. Without proper systems engineering practices, the development processes may lack holistic consideration of all system components, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delays.

-   Ineffective development processes can contribute to increased incidents of device failures. Without robust systems engineering practices, there's a higher likelihood of design flaws, inadequate testing, and safety issues in medical devices, leading to higher failure rates and potential harm to patients.

- **Low Adoption of Systems Engineering:** Due to the lack of understanding, there is low adoption of systems engineering practices in the medical device industry. This leads to insufficient incorporation of systems thinking, integration, and optimization in the development process of medical devices.

- **Ineffective Medical Device Development Processes:** 

- **Increased Incidents of Device Failures:** 

- **Loop Reinforcement:** The increased incidents of device failures further reinforce the perception of the importance of systems engineering. However, without addressing the root cause of the lack of understanding of systems engineering, this loop perpetuates, keeping systems engineering low in use in the medical device industry.

This causal loop illustrates how a lack of understanding of systems engineering for medical devices can create a reinforcing feedback loop that perpetuates low adoption of systems engineering practices, leading to ineffective development processes and increased incidents of device failures. Addressing this lack of understanding is crucial for improving the utilization of systems engineering in the medical device industry and enhancing the safety and reliability of medical devices.

### Very few papers on systems engineering of medical devices

There are very few papers on the application of systems engineering to medical devices that are published as articles, and/or presented in conferences.

In the 34th Annual INCOSE International Symposium, of the 83 papers presented none were in the context of medical devices. Of the 48 presentations, only 2 were in the context of medical devices [@is2024-].

An article database query was performed using a software called IHS Goldfire [@goldfire] to determine how many peer reviewed articles (including articles within books) discuss systems engineering of a medical device. IHS Goldfire is a software platform developed by IHS Markit that contains tools for knowledge discovery, problem-solving, technology scouting, innovation management, and intellectual property management. @tbl-query_results_papers shows the query results per application field. Between 1980 and 2024 there were a total of 3432 articles that discuss systems engineering of a medical device. This is significantly less than the 40732 peer reviewed articles found for systems engineering for military applications.

### Lack of books and literature of systems engineering of medical devices

The are very few books that teach systems engineering in the context of medical device development. Of the few books found are the following:

-   "*Robust Systems Engineering for Medical Device Design*" by Mr. Martin A. Coe. Description: This book introduces practical systems engineering methods for the design and development of commercially engineered systems, focused on the design of medical devices. It begins with systems engineering definitions, fundamentals and proceeds by integrating systems engineering activities into the development process to demonstrate a successful system design [@coe2019].

-   "*Healthcare Systems Engineering*" by Paul M. Griffin, et al. Description: Offers comprehensive coverage of the healthcare system, healthcare delivery, and healthcare systems modeling [@healthca].
