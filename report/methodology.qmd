The study adopts a Systems Engineering approach, which involves analyzing the entire content management process as a system with interconnected components. This methodology allows for a holistic understanding of the system's requirements, interactions, and potential improvements. The research methodology encompasses:

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Identifying the key requirements for efficient content management, including version control, compatibility with various file formats, and ease of collaboration.
2. **System Modeling:** Utilizing SysML (Systems Modeling Language) to create diagrams such as sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and state machine diagrams to visualize the content management process and its interactions.
3. **Evaluation:** Assessing existing tools and technologies for content management, including Quatro and its capabilities in rendering content into different formats like HTML and PDF.
4. **Proposal:** Proposing a refined content management methodology tailored to the specific needs of online reference books in medical device systems engineering.

## General methods

The following methodology was used for the Masters Project in Systems Engineering.

- Use Stevens Institute of Technology guidelines and templates for masters project.

- Develop the "knowledge repository" as a system: stakeholder needs, concept, architecture, models, requirements, verification/validation.

- Select and utilize systems engineering methods and tools from courses of Stevens School of Systems and Enterprises.

- Select and utilize industry standards such as IEC 15288 and the INCOSE (International Council on Systems Engineering) Systems Engineering Handbook @incose_incose_2023.

- Literature Review: Conduct an extensive review of existing literature, research papers, and relevant resources in the field of systems engineering and medical devices.

- Interviews and Surveys: Collect insights and best practices from industry experts, professionals, and academics in both systems engineering and medical device development.

- Content Development: Create well-structured chapters and sections based on the outlined scope, ensuring clarity and coherence throughout the book.

- Graphics and Illustrations: Include diagrams, flowcharts, and illustrations to enhance understanding and provide practical examples.

- Peer Review: Seek input and feedback from experts in the field to validate the content's accuracy and relevance.

- Use Git and/or GitHub as repository for the masterâ€™s project artifacts.
